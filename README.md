# AgriBridge

AgriBridge is a platform connecting farmers directly with consumers, built using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

AgriBridge aims to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by:
- Providing farmers with a direct channel to sell their produce
- Offering consumers access to fresh, locally-sourced products
- Reducing food waste and transportation costs
- Supporting local farming communities

## Getting Started

To get started with the AgriBridge project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm start`

## Available Scripts
